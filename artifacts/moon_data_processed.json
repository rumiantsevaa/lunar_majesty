You can give positive purpose to the moment and the circumstance.\n\nThere’s something you can do to make the situation better than it would otherwise be. Focus on that and bring new value to life.\n\nIt may not be easy, simple, or convenient to do so. Yet it is good, and fulfilling, and right.\n\nAct in a manner that affirms the value and the potential of life. Live in a way that you and those around you can continue to be thankful for as time goes on.\n\nThere’s a good reason why you’re in a particular place at a particular time. Open yourself to discover that reason and to act on it.\n\nMake meaning out of the raw material of existence that’s all around you. It’s always the best thing you can do.",
