Let go of all those negative thoughts that are hiding it from you, and allow yourself to experience it.\n\nYou are alive, aware, and able to act in this realm of limitless possibilities. Recognize the opportunity, and let it capture your imagination.\n\nPerhaps you’ve been tricked into thinking that very particular, limited, improbable circumstances are necessary for fulfillment. But that’s not the case.\n\nYou have countless avenues available for creating rich, satisfying, meaningful experiences. Follow willingly as your heart leads the way.\n\nGive your attention, your time and energy to the best of what’s possible for right now. Let go of any preconceived notions about what you need, and see the inherent goodness in all you have.\n\nEmbrace the magic of life that’s upon you, around you, within you. Find joy in expanding and extending it out in all directions.",
