      "content": "It’s a minor annoyance, a problem so small you really don’t need to do anything about it. But you’d better do something about it.\n\nBecause if you don’t, it will grow. What could have been easily dispatched can quickly become complicated and overwhelming.\n\nSo many times you’ll be tempted to deny there’s even a problem. Yet at some point denial is no longer possible, and you realize it never was a very good strategy.\n\nConfronting a problem and dealing with it is not the most enjoyable activity. That’s exactly why it’s best to quickly take action and get the problem behind you before it morphs into something bigger.\n\nAs soon as you see anything beginning to veer off track, take corrective action. The longer you wait, the more effort you’ll need to set things right.\n\nProblems are inevitable, but you don’t have to be overly burdened by them. Quickly step up to the problems and get control of each one long before it gets out of hand.",
