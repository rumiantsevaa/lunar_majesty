      "dream_interpretation": "Сон-\"дежавю\". Сны обманны и даже противоположны действительности. То, что снится в эти лунные сутки, надо понимать с точностью да наоборот. Могут сниться тяжелые сны, это связано с энергетикой суток. Иногда снятся сны, связанные с проблемами социального характера, сны которые показывают, где вы себя не принимаете.",
      "dream_interpretation_translated": "Sleep-\"dejavu\". Dreams are deceived and even opposite to reality. What is dreaming on these lunar days must be understood with accuracy, on the contrary. Severe dreams may dream, this is due to the energy of the day. Sometimes dreams related to social problems, dreams that show where you do not accept yourself."

      "content": "Don’t let excuses get in your way. Don’t let excuses steal your opportunities.\n\nExcuses accomplish nothing. The time and effort spent in concocting and explaining excuses is time you could be using to move forward.\n\nYes, you have challenges, you face obstacles that continue to arise. But rather than turning them into excuses, transform them into sources of determination and inspiration.\n\nWorking to get beyond a problem is a whole lot more effective than complaining about it. Leaning into a challenge provides a far greater return than using it as the basis for giving up.\n\nDecide what you intend to do, then commit yourself to making it happen in spite of whatever resistance you encounter. You can realistically choose to be energized by the difficulties rather than demoralized.\n\nResist the temptation to traffic in useless excuses. You have great work to do.",
